# Define your network interfaces here, then use ifup and ifdown to 
# bring them up and down.  Try not to use ifconfig directly.
#
# For dhcp interfaces, ifup will try dhclient, udhcpc, pump, and dhcpcd 
# (in that order, whichever it finds first under /sbin).
#
# Comment out an 'auto' line to disable an interface.

# This file is rewritten by WiFiAdmin.  You have been warned!
