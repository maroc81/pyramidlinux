<h2>Bit rate</h2>
<p>
For cards supporting multiple bit rates, set the bit rate in Mb/s. The
bit rate is the speed at which bits are transmitted over the medium. The
user speed of the link is lower due to medium sharing and various overhead.
</p>
<p>

Use <b>auto</b> / <b>best</b> to select automatic bit rate mode (fallback to
lower rate on noisy channels), which is the default for most cards.  Use
<b>fixed</b> and a value to lock the card to a particular bit rate. If you
specify auto and a specific rate, the driver will use all bit rates
lower and equal than this value.

Examples:
<ul>
<li>iwconfig eth0 rate 11M</li>
<li>iwconfig eth0 rate auto</li>
<li>iwconfig eth0 rate 5.5M auto</li>
</ul>
