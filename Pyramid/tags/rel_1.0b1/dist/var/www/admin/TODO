This is a list of features we would like to implement in versions to come:
* Make a new function, called execute, which takes the command string, executes it and returns the output.
  This function should check whether the command string is secure to be executed, maybe add a log entry, 
  append the command string and the output to the "console" etc.
* add a textarea, the "console", on the footer, where all executed commands and their output will be echoed
* Dynamic routing configuration. One more page to configure quagga routing
  deamons.
* Trigger the creation of graphs not by the cron deamon but every time a user requests the graphs 
* Make configuration persistent after reboot
* create a way to insert user-posted information on index.php. A user with this priviledge should have
  button in index. When pressed, a textbox appears, and he can insert whatever he likes. HTML tags allowed
  all data will be stored in a file and then posted in index.php everytime it is accessed.
* do iwconfig, ifconfig etc WITHOUT sudo, if you want just to READ values - important for security
